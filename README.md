# Asteroids
## A simple game that we all know

Firstly, let's actually download the game onto your system

```
git clone https://github.com/vilebile17/asteroids.git
cd asteroids
```

Next, make sure have a virtual enviroment installed so that you can run it in your terminal.
To do so, type into your terminal:

``` 
python3 -m venv venv
```

what this does is it creates a virtual enviroment called "venv".
Then run

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

to activate the virtual enviroment.
Finally, to run the game, type

```
python3 main.py
```

### And that's about it!
